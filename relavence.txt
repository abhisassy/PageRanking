	A 'rank value' is calculated for each document searched 
	And for every rank greater than the previous one , the document is appended to the list of results
	And the top results i.e. with the maximum rank value is listed , no. of results displayed will be max 'k'

	The formula for rank is as follows :

	Rank =	  (title_count   *  1000)
			+ (content_count *  50)
			+ (content_count_individual * 50)
			+ (count_of_longest_substring * %ofStringLen * 1)

   >title_count : is 1 if the entire query is present in the title, else 0
   	this is given the highest weightage of 1000 points. 

   >content_count : it is number of occurences of the entire query in the content of the document. It is given a weightage of 50 points 

   >content_count_individual : count of occurences of individual words of query 
   Same weightage of 50 points
   length of individual words of query capped at 3 to avoid stopper words 

   >count_of_longest_substring : finds the longest substring of the query present in the content and finds its count. The weightage depends on the length of the substring as well.
   weightage is given as : length(substring)/length(query) * 1
   length of substring is capped at 2 to avoid stopper words.
